This repository is a mixture of different problems I have solved and want to document it. A majority of chunk would also be Leetcode Solutions. 

## Overview

1) **LeetCode:** These are solutions to the problems I have solved on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). 
2) **Matrix_Class:** Here I have created my own implementation for a matrix class. More info can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/OpenSource_Problems/tree/master/Matrix_Class).
3) **Circular_Buffer:** This is my implementation of an overwriting Circular_Buffer. More info can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/OpenSource_Problems/tree/master/Circular_Buffer).
4) **Spherical Projection for Point Clouds:**  this is also known as Front View projection. Here, a 3D point cloud is converted into a 2D projected image. This is really useful as now tried and tested deep learning techniques can be applied on this image for varied applications like object detection and segmentation. The theory is explained in details on my medium post [here](https://medium.com/@topiwala.anirudh/spherical-projection-for-point-clouds-56a2fc258e6c) and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/OpenSource_Problems/tree/master/Spherical_View_Projection).
